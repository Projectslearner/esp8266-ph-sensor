# ESP8266 pH Sensor Project

#### Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use an ESP8266 microcontroller to interface with a pH sensor. The pH sensor measures the acidity or alkalinity of a solution and outputs an analog signal that the ESP8266 reads and converts into a pH value.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **pH Sensor**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the pH Sensor to ESP8266:**
   - Connect the analog output pin of the pH sensor to the A0 pin on the ESP8266.
   - Ensure proper power (VCC) and ground (GND) connections between the ESP8266 and the pH sensor.

#### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE with ESP8266 board support installed.
   - Create a new sketch and paste the provided Arduino code.
   - Connect the ESP8266 to your computer, select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the ESP8266.

2. **Operation:**
   - After uploading the code, open the Serial Monitor (baud rate: 9600).
   - The Serial Monitor will display the pH value of the solution connected to the pH sensor.
   - Immerse the pH sensor in the solution to observe the pH value.

#### Applications
- **Water Quality Monitoring:** Measure the pH level of water in aquariums, pools, or natural water bodies.
- **Agriculture:** Monitor soil pH to ensure optimal growing conditions for plants.
- **Laboratory Use:** Measure pH in various chemical experiments and solutions.

#### Notes
- **Calibration:** The calibration values in the code are approximate and may need adjustment based on your specific pH sensor and setup.
- **Voltage Conversion:** The analog value is converted to voltage based on the ESP8266's ADC reference voltage (3.3V).
- **Delay:** A 2-second delay is added between readings to allow the sensor to stabilize.
